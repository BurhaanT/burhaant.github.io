One of the greatest logging tools out there for .NET is log4net. This software is the gold standard for how logging should be done. It is simple, powerful, and extensible. The best part is that it is part of the FOSS community. What could be better? The one thing I see that is, in my opinion, a bit lacking is a straight-forward tutorial on how to use log4net. The documentation covers, in depth, how to use the software, but it is a bit obscure. Basically, if you already know what log4net can do and you just want to know the syntax, the documentation is for you. The tutorials out there usually cover one piece or one type of system. I am hoping to at least add to the tutorials that are out there, and maybe I might just provide you with a complete tutorial including questions to some of the problems I encountered.
