Firstly, I am a lover of Sublime Text. I've played around with many of the other 'popular' editors (Atom, Brackets, etc) but always end up back at Sublime Text.

I feel at peace when using the interface. The application is light-weight and fast and I can use it across OS's.

My drawback: C# is my go-to language and unless you remember all .Net / C# commands off by heart, Sublime Text will not be your friend - which means Visual Studio - In my case that entails starting up a VM on my machine yada, yada, yada.

Enter OmniSharp (tada!). Jonathan Channon walks through the steps to get you up an running:
